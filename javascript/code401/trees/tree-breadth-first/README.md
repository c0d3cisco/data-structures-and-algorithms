# Tree-breadth-first

## Problem Domain

The goal of this challenge was to obtain the values of a binary tree in a breadth first order. This method will take no input parameter and will return an array of the values in the tree in a breadth first order.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

The visualization step of whiteboarding was the best approach to tackle this challenge as picturing how these data structure operate in a First In Last Out for stacks and First In First Out for queues. The Big O time for this implementation of the findMax wis O(n) where n is the total number of nodes in the tree, while the space complex is O(1) as the size of the output will always be the same.
