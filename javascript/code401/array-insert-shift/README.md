# Code Challenge 2 - Insert and Shift Array

This code challenge required for a function called *insertShiftArray* that takes in an array and a value and returns an array with the value added in the middle order without using any built in methods available in JavaScript. If the length of the array is odd (meaning there is no true center place to add the value), add the value to the right of the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Since the size of the length is known, a for loop was picked.

**BigO**

Time: O(n)\
Space: O(1)
