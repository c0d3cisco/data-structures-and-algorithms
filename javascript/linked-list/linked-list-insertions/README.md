## Approach & Efficiency

The approach as to rely on the vizualizatio to think out the states of current, which is critical for understanding what a linked list method might be doing.

BigO Time - O(n) since the time scaling is linear based on the size of the input\
BigO Space - O(1) since the size of the input and output does not change.

## Solution

Modification to the code after testing was needed.\
git clone this repository into a desired location.\
Inside the repository, run `npm install`.\
