## Approach & Efficiency

BigO Time - O(n) since the time scaling is linear based on the size of the input\
BigO Space - O(1) since the size of the input and output does not change.

## Solution

git clone this repository into a desired location.\
Inside the repository, run `npm install`.\
Navigate to the JavaScript folder and run `npm test linked-list.test.js`
